   - Content moderation tools
   - Analytics and reporting

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Image optimization
   - Caching strategies
   - Bundle optimization

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests for components
   - Integration tests for API calls
   - End-to-end testing

4. **Deployment**
   - Production environment configuration
   - CI/CD pipeline setup
   - Database migration scripts

## Backend Dependencies
This integration assumes the Spring Boot backend is running with the following endpoints as documented in `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`. All major endpoints have been implemented and tested in the frontend.

## Usage
1. Start the Spring Boot backend on `http://localhost:8080`
2. Install frontend dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and configure API URL
4. Start the frontend: `npm run dev`
5. Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

The frontend is now fully integrated with the backend API and all major functionality is working as expected.
